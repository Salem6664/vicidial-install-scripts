# VICIDIAL INSTALLATION SCRIPTS (Default is Eastern Time Zone US)
# Centos, Rocky and AlmaLinux Vicidial Install pre_requisites 
# I have created a faster auto installer for Alma and Rocky 9 that will also install the dynamic portal and the CyburPhone

## Copy & Paste the part blow:

```

timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

yum check-update
yum update -y
yum -y install epel-release
yum update -y
yum install git -y
yum install -y kernel*

#Disable SELINUX
sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config    

cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/Salem6664/vicidial-install-scripts.git

reboot

````
  

This first installer is the one I keep most up to date and use personally for all my clients. it is the one I recommend that you use.
If you do not install the SSL cert during the initiial install, you have to turn the firewall off before trying to do it after a reboot. Dont forget to turn it back on. Also, by default the firewall will leave port 443 open to the public, so you can login and change the default password. Make sure you remove it from the public zone once your setup is done. Check this article for use of firewalld: https://dialer.one/how-to-use-firewalld-via-command-line/
